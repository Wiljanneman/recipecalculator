# Recipe Optimizer

Recipe Optimizer is an application that helps you determine the optimal combination of recipes to maximize the number of people fed based on the ingredients you have available. The app prioritizes recipes based on their efficiency (feeds per ingredient), calculates the maximum possible counts for each recipe, updates the available ingredients accordingly, and computes the total number of people that can be fed.

## Features

- **Ingredient Management**: Easily input and manage your available ingredients.
- **Recipe Efficiency Calculation**: Automatically calculates feeds per ingredient for each active recipe.
- **Optimal Recipe Combination**: Determines the optimal combination of recipes to maximize the number of people fed.
- **Dynamic Ingredient Updates**: Adjusts available ingredients based on selected recipes and their counts.
